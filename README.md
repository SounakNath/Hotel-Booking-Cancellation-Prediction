# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

Here, we try to predict whether hotel booking will be cancelled or not.


We have been provided a dataset **"hotel_bookings.csv"** which contains around 120k data entries.


We perform exploratory data analysis, (such as box-plot, heatmap) on the dataset to would provide futher insights.


Below steps are performed:


  * Feature Extraction
  * Handling Categorical Data
  * Handling Outliers
  * Feature Selection

After finishing all preprocessing steps, we split the dataset into training and test set.


Finally, we apply multiple Machine Learning models such as LogisticRegression, Naive Bayes, RandomForest, Decision Tree, KNN to find out which model will yield the most acurate prediction.
